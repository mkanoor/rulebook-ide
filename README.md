- **Dynamic Forwarding**: Enable/disable webhook forwarding to ansible-rulebook after analyzing payloads
- **Multiple Rulesets**: Support for managing multiple rulesets within a single rulebook
- **Flexible Sources**: Add and configure event sources with dynamic configuration
- **Condition Editor**: Edit rule conditions as strings or structured objects (all/any/not_all)
- **Action Management**: Support for all action types including:
  - debug
  - print_event
  - run_playbook
  - run_module
  - run_job_template
  - run_workflow_template
  - set_fact
  - retract_fact
  - post_event
  - shutdown
  - none
- **YAML Import/Export**: Import existing YAML rulebooks and export your work
- **Live YAML Preview**: View the generated YAML in a separate window
- **Schema Validation**: Built on the official Ansible Rulebook schema

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **(Optional)** Create a `.env.local` file for environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` to configure:
- Custom `PORT` (default: 5555)
- `NGROK_API_TOKEN` (required for Cloud Tunnels - get from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com))
- Custom `ANSIBLE_RULEBOOK_PATH`

⚠️ **Security Note**: `.env` files contain sensitive data and are automatically excluded from git. Never commit them to your repository!

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server on port 5555 (or custom `PORT`) |
| `npm run stop` | Stop the server (works with default or custom `PORT`) |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

## Running the Application

Start the unified development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This single command starts:
- The Express server with Vite middleware (frontend with HMR)
- The WebSocket server (backend)
- All on one port: `http://localhost:5555`

Stop the server from any terminal window:

```bash
npm run stop
```

### Custom Port

Run on a custom port using the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
# Start on custom port
PORT=8080 npm run dev

# Stop the custom port server
PORT=8080 npm run stop
```

## Execution Mode

The IDE leverages ansible-rulebook's native WebSocket capabilities to provide real-time testing and monitoring of your rulebooks.

### How It Works

**ansible-rulebook** includes built-in WebSocket support that enables:
- **Dynamic rulebook loading** - Fetches rulebook content over WebSocket instead of from files
- **Real-time status reporting** - Streams rule triggers, actions, and events back to the IDE
- **Remote execution control** - Supports start, stop, and configuration via WebSocket messages

When you click **Start Execution**, the IDE:
1. Spawns `ansible-rulebook` in `--worker` mode with a WebSocket URL
2. Sends your rulebook and variables to ansible-rulebook over the WebSocket connection
3. Receives real-time events as rules fire and actions execute
4. Displays rule triggers, event data, and execution status in the UI

This architecture allows the IDE to provide immediate feedback without writing temporary files or requiring manual ansible-rulebook invocation.

### Prerequisites

- ansible-rulebook must be installed
  - The server looks for `ansible-rulebook` in your system PATH by default
  - You can specify a custom path by setting the `ANSIBLE_RULEBOOK_PATH` environment variable
  - Example: `ANSIBLE_RULEBOOK_PATH=/path/to/venv/bin/ansible-rulebook npm run dev`
  - Or add it to your `.env.local` file: `ANSIBLE_RULEBOOK_PATH=/path/to/venv/bin/ansible-rulebook`

### Using Execution Mode

1. Click the **▶️ Execute** button in the toolbar
2. Optionally, add extra variables in JSON format
3. Click **Start Execution**
4. The ansible-rulebook process will be **automatically started** in worker mode
   - Command: `ansible-rulebook --worker --id <uuid> --websocket-url ws://localhost:5555`
   - The process connects to the IDE's WebSocket server
   - Rulebook and variables are transmitted via WebSocket (no temporary files)
5. Watch as rules are triggered in real-time:
   - Rules that are triggered will be highlighted in yellow
   - The event log shows all events from ansible-rulebook
   - Triggered rules display a "TRIGGERED" badge with animation

### Features

- **Real-time rule highlighting** - See which rules fire as events come in
- **Event streaming** - View all events (Job, Action, ProcessedEvent, etc.) from ansible-rulebook
- **WebSocket communication** - Uses ansible-rulebook's native `--worker` mode for bidirectional communication
- **No temporary files** - Rulebook content sent directly via WebSocket
- **Extra variables** - Pass variables to your rulebook at runtime
- **Start/Stop control** - Control execution from the UI

## Cloud Tunnels (External Webhook Access)

The IDE includes a **Cloud Tunnel** feature that allows you to receive webhooks from external sources (like GitHub, GitLab, monitoring systems, etc.) using ngrok. This is perfect for testing webhook-based event sources. This is only visible if the ngrok token has been added in **🔧 Settings**

### Prerequisites

1. **Create a free ngrok account**:
   - Visit [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Navigate to "Your Authtoken" in the dashboard
   - Copy your authtoken

2. **Configure ngrok token in the IDE**:
   - Click the **🔧 Settings** button in the toolbar
   - Paste your ngrok API token in the "Ngrok API Token" field
   - Click **Save Settings**

### Using Cloud Tunnels

1. **Create a Tunnel**:
   - Click the **☁️ Cloud Tunnel** button in the toolbar (appears after configuring ngrok token)
   - Set the local port (e.g., 5556)
   - Click **☁️ Create Tunnel**
   - A public URL will be generated (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)

2. **Analyze Incoming Webhooks**:
   - Configure your external service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to send webhooks to the public URL
   - Incoming webhooks will appear in the **Event Log**
   - The payload will automatically open in the **🔍 JSON Path Explorer**
   - Use the JSON Path Explorer to understand the webhook structure and copy JSONPath expressions

3. **Enable Dynamic Forwarding** (Optional):
   - After analyzing the webhook payload, you can enable forwarding to your ansible-rulebook webhook source
   - In the Cloud Tunnel modal, go to the "🔄 Webhook Forwarding" section
   - Select a webhook source from your rulebook
   - Click **Enable Forwarding**
   - Now incoming webhooks will be forwarded to ansible-rulebook for processing

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start the IDE
npm run dev

# 2. In the IDE:
#    - Configure ngrok token in Settings
#    - Create a cloud tunnel on port 5556
#    - Configure GitHub webhook to use the public URL

# 3. Receive a webhook from GitHub
#    - View the payload in JSON Path Explorer
#    - Design your rule condition based on the actual payload structure
#    - Example: event.payload.commits[0].message contains "deploy"

# 4. Create a webhook source in your rulebook
#    - Add a webhook source on port 5435 (your rulebook port)

# 5. Enable forwarding
#    - In Cloud Tunnel modal, enable forwarding to port 5435
#    - Start ansible-rulebook execution
#    - Webhooks will now flow: External → Cloud Tunnel → ansible-rulebook
```

### Features

- **Webhook Inspection** - View and analyze webhook payloads before processing
- **JSON Path Explorer** - Extract JSONPath expressions from real webhook data
- **Dynamic Forwarding** - Enable/disable forwarding without recreating the tunnel
- **Multiple Ports** - Create tunnels on different ports for different services

## Building for Production

Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

This serves pre-built static files from `dist/` with the WebSocket server on port 5555.
